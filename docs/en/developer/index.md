# Plugin System Overview

<img src="./images/tuneflow_wall_thin.jpg">

TuneFlow provides developers with a powerful and easy-to-implement plugin platform, which allows you to read the entire project information and use TuneFlow's underlying capabilities by writing plugins.

Unlike the limitations of traditional DAW plugin systems, which are only for single-track, audio/MIDI signal processing, TuneFlow's plugin system allows you to develop more systematic plugins from a global perspective, such as:

- Integrating AI models to continue writing melodies or adding multi-track harmonies;
- Generating drum beats that fit the structure of the entire song;
- You can even manipulate audio plugins on each track and use algorithms to generate automation for each parameter.

Now, let's dive into the basics of TuneFlow's plugin system:
